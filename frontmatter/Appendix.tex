\subsection*{CircuitMode}
An enum, named \texttt{CircuitMode}, was defined in MATLAB to delineate the possible modes of the power supply circuit. Enumerations in MATLAB are a form of user-defined data type, where the values can be any of a specified set of constants. This provides a clean, intuitive, and semantic way of dealing with categorical data in a codebase.

The power supply circuit operates in four possible modes which are influenced by the switching conditions of the primary and secondary switches in the multi-mode load

\subsection*{Division of Work}
Work was done collaboratively as a group across all sections. Each member contributed together in the planning, brainstorming, analysis and implementation. However, we all had our own focus areas that we worked on primarily.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Jesse} focused on Device Modelling, MATLAB implementation of numerical analysis \& Visualisation design \& implementation
	\item \textbf{David} focused on Circuit Modelling, Numerical Analysis
	\item \textbf{Omar} focused on Simulation, Presentation and Analysis of Results and Visualisation implementation \& presentation
\end{itemize}
The report was written as a group, with each member contributing primarily to their respective sections.
