\subsection*{CircuitMode}
An enum, named \texttt{CircuitMode}, was defined in MATLAB to delineate the possible modes of the power supply circuit. Enumerations in MATLAB are a form of user-defined data type, where the values can be any of a specified set of constants. This provides a clean, intuitive, and semantic way of dealing with categorical data in a codebase.

The power supply circuit operates in four possible modes which are influenced by the switching conditions of the primary and secondary switches in the multi-mode load
