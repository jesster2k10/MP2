The power supply is terminated by a multi-mode load resistor modelled by its Thevenin equivalent circuit. The circuit has multiple modes of operation depending on the switching of its devices. The circuit is presented below.

The performance of the circuit is to be determined for all modes of operation. A mathematical model of the circuit is derived for use in numerical analysis and simulation. A visualisation is presented at the end with the results.
